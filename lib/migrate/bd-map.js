/**
 * bd-map.js — the bd vocabulary maps + a READ-ONLY shadow-dogfood projector (spike, not the shipped migrator).
 *
 * Projects a `bd export` JSONL snapshot into the flat-YAML task-schema shape,
 * applying the 9→4 type collapse this schema is built on: bd's nine issue types
 * become four exclusive kinds (`task` / `doc` / `decision` / `milestone`), with
 * bd's other five surviving as additive LABELS on a `task` (see TYPE_MAP below,
 * and the type model in `../schema.js`). This is deliberately the read-only HALF
 * of the full migration: it never writes into the task store, bd stays canonical,
 * and the projection is meant to be regenerated (never hand-edited) and thrown
 * away. Its purpose was to give that type-model decision its first implementation
 * feedback — dual-run the projected output against `bd ready` and compare — not to
 * ship a production migration path. `projectRecords` was exported for reuse by the
 * real migrator's eventual test suite; this spike itself ships untested by design,
 * its one-time job being done.
 *
 * The FULL lossless migrator (acceptance-criteria extraction from markdown,
 * comment history, --scrub handling, writing into the real substrate) shipped
 * separately, and IS `./bootstrap.js`. This script intentionally does LESS than
 * that and says so in its loss report.
 *
 * Usage — DIRECT EXECUTION ONLY. The CLI entry at the bottom sits behind an
 * `import.meta.url === argv[1]` guard, so the `migrate` subcommand does NOT reach it;
 * that runs the real migrator. Run this file itself, with two positionals:
 *
 *   bd export -o /tmp/bd-export.jsonl --readonly
 *   node <this-file> /tmp/bd-export.jsonl /tmp/tasks-shadow.yml
 *
 * (Its own usage message still names the CLI form. That message is stale, not a
 * second entry point — there is no route to this projector but direct execution.)
 *
 * Guardrail: refuses to write under any store's `tasks/` directory, in either form of
 * the name pair — the projection is scratch-only by construction, not an accident of
 * discipline.
