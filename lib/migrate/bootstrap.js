/**
 * bootstrap.js — the bd → flat-YAML migrator (`diarie migrate`).
 *
 * The write-half the read-only spike (`bd-map.js`) deliberately isn't.
 * Reads a `bd export` JSONL snapshot and evacuates the LIVE issues (everything
 * not `closed`) into the real substrate, under `--root`:
 *
 *   <root>/<store>/tasks/tasks-<slug>.yml     live tasks, grouped (see --epic)
 *   <root>/<store>/decisions/<id>.md          decision-type issues (prose has no YAML home)
 *   <root>/<store>/_archive/bd-final-export.jsonl   the full snapshot (ALL statuses) — the
 *                                            only git-tracked survivor of bd history,
 *                                            since `.beads/` is gitignored.
 *
 * `<store>` is `diarium/`, or `.diarium/` with `--dotted` — the posture the target repo
 * wants (decision `diarie-pos`). The overwrite guard checks EVERY store name, not just the
 * one this run would write; see the comment on it.
 *
 * ORIGINALLY a one-shot for a single project (it hardcoded that repo's migration
 * epic and its two slugs). It was generalized to run against ANY bd repo — beads
 * 1.1.0's write-break hit every repo on the global binary at once, so the sibling
 * repos needed the same evacuation. That reverses the original plan to retire it
 * after one run: a tool other repos depend on earns kept test coverage (see
 * `test/migrate.spec.js`), because its failure mode is SILENT
 * DATA LOSS, not a crash. It is still a bootstrap, not a CRUD tool — ongoing
 * writes stay plain hand-edits to the YAML (the substrate ships no CRUD helper, by
 * design).
 *
 * What it does beyond the spike, each learned the hard way:
 *
 *   - `deferred` is preserved as `deferred` (the schema has the status); the
 *     spike approximated it to `cancelled`.
 *   - `## Acceptance Criteria` bullets are extracted into `acceptance_criteria`;
 *     the rest of each body is preserved as `description` (lossless — `validate`
 *     accepts the field and the ready computation ignores it entirely; groom later
 *     if a terser model is preferred).
 *   - Some bd bodies store literal backslash-n instead of real newlines, which
 *     un-anchors the `## Acceptance Criteria` heading and SILENTLY drops the
 *     criteria. Normalized before parsing.
 *   - An edge whose target is not in the live set is DROPPED, not dangled — a
 *     closed blocker is already satisfied, and a closed parent is history. Both
 *     are reported; the original edges live on in the archive JSONL.
 *
 * Two guards, because this now runs against repos that are not this one:
 *
 *   - `--root` defaults to the CURRENT DIRECTORY, never this package's own checkout.
 *     A script-relative default would make a forgotten `--root` clobber the tracker
 *     of whatever tree the installed code sits in, with some other project's issues.
 *   - An existing `tasks-*.yml` store is a HARD STOP (`--force` to override).
 *     The migration is one-way: re-running replays the export over hand-edits.
 *
 * Usage (`<epic-id>` is an id from your own bd export — the epic whose descendants
 * you want routed into their own `tasks-<slug>.yml`):
 *
 *   bd export -o /tmp/bd-export.jsonl
 *   diarie migrate /tmp/bd-export.jsonl --root . \
 *     --epic <epic-id>=migration \
 *     --title migration='Tracker migration off bd' \
 *     --default-slug backlog \
 *     --title backlog='Standalone backlog (non-epic live work)'
 *
 * Dry-run: point `--root` at a scratch dir and diff before writing for real.
