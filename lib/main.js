  // means a CI job branching on 2 cannot tell a dependency cycle from a typo.
  //
  // "NO COMMAND" IS NOT "NO ARGUMENTS", and peowly-commands has TWO rules for it, not one
  // (lib/main.js:30-35): a leading-dash first token is nulled out, and then a FALSY one fails the
  // truthiness gate. Both end at `cli.showHelp()`.
  //
  // Each rule cost a round to learn. Matching only `argv.length === 0` left `diarie --json`
  // exiting 2 with 589 bytes of human help prose on stdout — under the flag that promises
  // machine-readable output. Fixing only the dash left `diarie ""` doing exactly the same thing,
  // because `''.startsWith('-')` is false, so an empty token "named a command" here and then
  // failed peowly's truthiness gate there. `diarie "$CMD"` with an unset variable is how a wrapper
  // script, a Makefile, or a CI job writes it — the ordinary case, not the adversarial one.
  //
  // So: both halves. `!!argv[0]` is not redundant with the dash check, however much it looks it.
