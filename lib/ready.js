 *
 * Ready rule: a task is READY iff it is `type: task`, `status: pending`, has no open
 * dependency, AND is not a container (no open children, no `epic` label). BLOCKED if a
 * dep or a child is still pending/in_progress. NEEDS_ATTENTION if a dep or child is
 * failed/cancelled/deferred/missing, if a `parent:` dangles, or if an `epic` has nothing
 * open left inside it. Non-task types (`doc`/`decision`/`milestone`) are records or
 * markers, never work — they never appear in any partition, and never block one.
 * (The graph is recomputed, never enforced — see validate.js for the integrity gate.)

 * The child taxonomy deliberately MIRRORS the dep taxonomy below — same three buckets,

 * reader should not have to learn two vocabularies:
 *
 *   pending / in_progress          -> ACTIVE   : real remaining work; the parent is blocked
 *   completed                      -> done     : contains nothing; ignore
 *   failed / cancelled / deferred  -> STALLED  : needs a human, not a blocker
 *
 * The first cut got this wrong in a way worth recording. "Open child" was defined as
 * `status !== 'completed'` — the acceptance criterion's own words — which quietly swept
 * the terminal statuses into ACTIVE. A parent whose only child was `cancelled` then sat
 * in `blocked` forever, unworkable, with nothing to point at and no way out: the very
 * "offered nothing, said nothing" failure this module exists to prevent, reintroduced by
 * the fix for it. Deps had always got this right; the children just had to be told.
 *
 * Only `type: task` children count. `decision` records are safe by construction (they
 * live in `.diarie/decisions/`, outside `loadTasks`'s glob) — but `milestone` is NOT:
 * it lives in `tasks-*.yml`, it has "no effort, no assignment", so it is never worked and
 * therefore never `completed`. A milestone filed under an epic would have blocked it
 * until the heat death of the repository.

/**
 * Compute ready / blocked / needs-attention partitions over a flat task list.
 *
 * A CONTAINER is never ready — you work its children, not the container. Two
 * predicates, and they are independent on purpose:
 *
 *   structural  — has at least one open child        → blocked, by those children
 *   declarative — carries the `epic` label           → never workable, children or not
 *
 * bd had an `epic` TYPE, so its ready-walk excluded containers structurally. This schema
 * collapsed epic to `task` + `parent:` (the better model — see the type model in
 * `./schema.js`), which left `computeReady` gating on type alone. The result was a real
 * bug: an epic container, having no dependencies of its own and being `type: task` like
 * anything else, sailed through every check and was offered as the single next thing to
 * work on — while the children that held the actual work stayed invisible behind it.
 * Collapsing the type is what removed the structural exclusion; these two predicates are
 * what put it back.
 *
 * `blockers` and `children` are separate fields because they mean different things:
 * a dep must FINISH FIRST, a child is CONTAINED. Collapsing them into one array would
 * make "blocked by" ambiguous exactly where it needs to be precise.
 *
 * @param {Task[]} tasks
 * @returns {{ ready: Task[], blocked: Array<Task & { blockers: string[], children?: string[], attention?: string[] }>, needsAttention: Array<Task & { reason: string }> }}
