 * only; the cause chain is deliberately hidden, because a stack trace is not an
 * answer to "you pointed me at the wrong directory".
 *
 * `ResultError` — the operation ran and the answer is "no". Exit 2, no message:
 * the command has already said its piece on stdout. `validate` finding errors is
 * the canonical case — the errors ARE the output.
