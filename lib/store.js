/**
 * store.js — locating and loading the flat-YAML task store.
 *
 * THE ONLY PLACE THAT KNOWS HOW TO FIND A STORE, and the only place that can
 * say it failed to. Everything else takes a resolved root.
 *
 * ## Why a missing store is an ERROR
 *
 * The tracker's first reader (a loose script, long since replaced by this package)
 * resolved its root from `import.meta.url` — its own location on disk — and, when it
 * found nothing there, printed an empty backlog and exited 0:
 *
 *     $ TASKS_ROOT=/tmp/empty <the-old-reader> --format json
 *     no store found under /tmp/empty …                      <- stderr
 *     { "ready": [], "blocked": [], "needsAttention": [] }   <- stdout
 *     $ echo $?
 *     0
 *
 * stdout carried a well-formed, entirely fictional "you have no work", and the
 * only signal that the tool was lost went to stderr — which ten call sites pipe
 * to /dev/null. An ABSENT store and an EMPTY store were indistinguishable to
 * every consumer.
 *
 * So: **only "I was told to look and found nothing" is an error.** An empty
 * backlog is a legitimate answer; a missing store is a question we cannot answer.
 *
 *   store root not found  -> ENOSTORE, non-zero exit
 *   .diarie/ but no tasks/     -> valid empty backlog, exit 0
 *   tasks/ but no tasks-*.yml  -> valid empty backlog, exit 0
 *   tasks-*.yml with `tasks: []` -> valid empty backlog, exit 0
 *
 * This is also what makes the tracker safe to package: once the code lives in
 * `node_modules/diarie/lib/`, an `import.meta.url`-relative root would point at
 * the package's own directory. Under the old contract that bug was invisible
 * (empty store, exit 0, checks green). Under this one it is a hard failure on
 * the first run.

 * into every user's plugin cache. This CLI resolves a store by walking UP from cwd. Run it

 * of failure this store module exists to end.
 *
 * `--root` prevents it, and well-behaved callers pass `--root`. But callers documented in
 * PROSE forget: an audit of one such plugin found 71 documented invocations, not one of
 * which passed it. A defense that depends on every future sentence remembering is not a
 * defense.
 *
 * So the refusal lives HERE, where it cannot rot. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is set by Claude
 * Code for plugin-spawned processes; a store beneath it is never the user's store. An
 * explicit `--root` is still honoured — if you genuinely mean to read the plugin's own
