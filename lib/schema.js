/**
 * schema.js — the single canonical schema for the flat-YAML task substrate.
 *
 * THIS IS THE AUTHORITY. `ready.js`, `validate.js`, `store.js`, the migrator, and every
 * downstream consumer derive their vocabulary from here — never fork it. The enum Sets
 * carry the runtime vocabulary; the matching `@typedef` unions carry the type-level
 * vocabulary, checked by the type-check gate.
 *
 * A `<store>/tasks/tasks-<slug>.yml` file is (`<store>` = `diarium/` or `.diarium/`):
 *
 *   tasks:                    # top-level: a list (required)
 *     - id: T-1               # unique within the file; namespaced to slug/id on load
 *       title: ...            # required
 *       status: pending       # required; one of VALID_STATUSES
 *       type: task            # required; one of VALID_TYPES (4 kinds — see below)
 *       priority: medium      # optional; one of VALID_PRIORITIES (default medium)
 *       labels: [bug]         # optional LIST of strings; framings live here, not in type
 *       parent: T-0           # optional; an id in the same or another (slug/id) file
 *       deps: [T-0]           # optional LIST; bare ids resolve to slug/id, `slug/id` pass through
 *       acceptance_criteria:  # optional LIST; the test-ratchet checks it on completed work
 *         - ...
 *       agent: loop-1         # optional; set when claimed (status in_progress)
 *       updated: "2026-06-10" # optional; ISO date — staleness is computed from it
 *       description: |        # optional; the free-text body (see note below)
 *         free-text body
 *
 * `description` is a RATIFIED optional field (2026-07-11). It was introduced by
 * the bd→YAML migration to preserve each issue's body losslessly, which reversed
 * the original no-body design (an earlier retrospective had deflated "missing body"
 * as by-design) — so it was held for a decision, and the decision is KEEP. The
 * evidence: every migrated task carried one, and they hold the *why* a title cannot
 * — an issue's provenance, and the scoping data behind its estimate. Dropping them
 * would have moved that context to an archive nobody reads while working.
 *
 * It stays OPTIONAL and free-text: a terse row is still a legitimate row, and the
 * ready computation ignores this field entirely (it is prose for humans, never a
 * computation input). If a future unknown-field warning is added to `validate`, it
 * must allowlist `description` or every migrated task will flag at once.
 *
 * Type model (2026-06-10): 4 exclusive kinds — `task` (work), `doc` (reference),
 * `decision` (record), `milestone` (marker). bd's other five types (`bug` /
 * `feature` / `chore` / `story` / `spike`) are FRAMINGS of `task`, carried in
 * `labels:`; `epic` is `task` + `parent:` nesting (or an `epic` label). The enum
 * stays exclusive (exactly one type per item — the property labels can't give);
 * the framings stay additive. A type answers "what kind of thing is this", which
 * admits exactly one answer; a label answers "how should I think about it", which
 * admits several. That is the whole argument for collapsing 9 types into 4.
 * Spike's "closes with findings, not code" semantics travel with the `spike` label.
 *
 * `doc` and `decision` do NOT live as rows in `tasks-<slug>.yml`; their
 * content-home is frontmatter'd markdown under `<store>/decisions/<id>.md`
 * and `<store>/docs/<id>.md` (the frontmatter carries the schema fields; the
 * body is the prose the terse row can't hold). `milestone` rows DO live in
 * `tasks-*.yml` (markers, no prose). Because the loader only globs `tasks-*.yml`,
 * decision/doc files are naturally outside the ready computation — a decision
 * "in force" is never surfaced as workable. (bd got this wrong: its ready-walk is
 * type-blind and lists decisions as ready work.)
 *
 * Ready rule (the only computation that gates work): an item is READY iff
 * `type === 'task'`, `status === 'pending'`, every dep is `completed`, AND it is not a
 * CONTAINER — a task with open children, or one carrying the `epic` label, is the sum of
 * its children and never work in itself. (Getting that wrong is a real bug with a real
 * symptom: an epic, having no dependencies of its own, is offered as the next thing to
 * work on, and the actual work — its children — is never surfaced.) Non-task types
 * (`doc`/`decision`/`milestone`) never appear in ready/blocked/needsAttention — they are
 * records or markers, not work (a milestone has "no effort, no assignment") — and for the
 * same reason they never BLOCK one either. Both `deps` (the `blocks` analog) and `parent`
 * (containment) affect readiness; transitivity is emergent via the status invariant (a
 * task can't be `completed` until it was itself ready), not a graph walk.
 *
 * Atomic-write contract (load-bearing invariant): the substrate assumes a SOLO,
 * SINGLE-HOST developer with NO concurrent writers to the same `tasks-<slug>.yml`.
 * Anything that fans work out in parallel must uphold that itself — partition by
 * file, one owner per slug, so two writers never hold the same `tasks-<slug>.yml`
 * at once. Writers mutate tasks by editing the YAML directly; there is deliberately
 * no CRUD helper (the store is a substrate, not a product with an opinion about how
 * you change it). If the invariant is ever violated (multi-writer), the upgrade is
 * write-then-rename, not a lock daemon.

 * A BRAND, not an alias. `GlobalId` is assignable to `string`, but a plain `string` is
 * NOT assignable to `GlobalId` — and the only thing that mints one is `nsId()` below.
 *
 * It exists because of a real bug. `loadTasks` globalized `id` and `deps` and left `parent`
 * raw, so `parent` could never equal any `id`. Every type involved was `string`, so nothing
 * complained. The container rule was the first code to trust `parent`, and it would have
 * found zero children for every epic, excluded nothing, and passed a green suite.
 *
 * `unknown` does NOT catch it — you satisfy `unknown` with `String(x)`, which is the bug.
 *
 * **A template-literal type `` `${string}/${string}` `` DOES catch it**, and an earlier
 * version of this comment claimed otherwise ("only a brand can…"). That was false, and it
 * was disproved by probe, not by argument: swapping the brand for the template type keeps
 * tsc at zero errors, keeps type-coverage identical, and still rejects the reverted bug.
 * The claim is corrected rather than quietly deleted, because a comment that overstates its
 * own guard is how the next reader gets talked out of a cheaper, better one.
 *
 * What the brand adds over the template type is **provenance, not detection**: any
 * `` `${a}/${b}` `` satisfies the template, whereas a `GlobalId` can only be minted by
 * `nsId()` below. Given that the whole bug was one caller globalizing by hand and another
 * forgetting to, "only nsId may produce these" is the property actually worth buying — but
 * it is a different property than the one that catches the typo, and they should not be
