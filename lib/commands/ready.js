/**
 * `diarie ready` — what can be worked on right now.
 *
 * THE load-bearing primitive. A task is ready iff `type: task`, `status: pending`,
 * and every dep is `completed`. Non-task types (doc/decision/milestone) are records
 * or markers and never surface as work — a decision in force is not a chore.
 *
 * TWO OUTPUT SHAPES, both pinned by consumers:
 *
 *   ready --json            -> OBJECT  {ready, blocked, needsAttention}
 *   ready --filter <status> -> ARRAY   [task, …]
 *
 * They differ on purpose (a partition vs a plain list), and a consumer that reads both — a
 * session-start hook, say — parses each in a different branch. Do not "unify" them without
 * changing every such consumer.
 *
 * FOUR PARTS (peowly-commands' shape — `example/complete/commands/single/index.js`):
 * `run()` holds no logic; `setupCommand` parses; `doTheWork` RETURNS DATA and never
 * prints; `formatWorkResult` is the only writer. The third part is the point — it is
 * what makes the work assertable in-process, with no spawn and no stdout capture.
 * `doTheWork` is exported for exactly that reason (the reference keeps it internal,
 * but the reference does not unit-test it).
