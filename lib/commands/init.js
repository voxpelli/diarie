/**
 * `diarie init` — create a store.
 *
 * The one command that must accept a root with NO store, so it uses
 * `resolveInitRoot` rather than `requireRoot` — you are naming where the store WILL
 * be, not asking us to find one.
 *
 * It refuses to touch an existing store. A tracker that can silently clobber your
 * backlog is not a tracker; and the whole premise here is that the data IS the repo,
 * so an overwrite is a `git checkout` away from being permanent.
 *
 * What it writes is deliberately tiny — a store is a directory and a list. There is
 * no `.diarierc`, no config, no state file. If this command ever grows a template
 * engine, something has gone wrong with the substrate.
 *
 * Four parts, even though the work here is a SIDE EFFECT rather than a computation:
 * `doTheWork` writes the store and returns what it created, and `formatWorkResult`
 * decides how to say so. The refusal lives in `doTheWork` because it is a fact about
 * the disk, not about the arguments. (`migrate` is the one command with no such split
 * — its flags are repeatable `key=value` pairs parsed by the migrator itself.)
