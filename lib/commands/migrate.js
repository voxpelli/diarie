/**
 * `diarie migrate` — one-way cutover from a `bd export` JSONL into a diarie store.
 *
 * A thin wrapper over `runMigration`, which is the same code path the standalone
 * script uses. There is one migrator, not a library plus a drifting copy — the
 * failure mode here is SILENT DATA LOSS (it has already destroyed decision bodies
 * once, in review), so a second implementation would be a second chance to lose
 * someone's backlog.
 *
 * Flags are parsed inside runMigration (node:util parseArgs), not by peowly: its
 * `--epic`/`--title` are REPEATABLE key=value pairs, and the guards that consume
 * them are the tested part. Re-declaring the surface here would be a place for the
 * two to drift.
