/**
 * format.js — output.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT `markdown-or-chalk`, which the node-cli-template uses. Measured:
 * it costs 83 transitive packages and ~10 MB, and drags in `yargs@16` via
 * `cli-highlight` — the very library `peowly` was chosen to avoid. Almost all of
 * that weight is a markdown renderer for syntax-highlighted code fences. diarie
 * emits a task list, some counts, and validation errors. It renders no code.
 *
 * If diarie ever grows output worth rendering as markdown, revisit — the finding is
 * logged in UPSTREAM-markdown-or-chalk.md, not buried here.
 *
 * The stdout/stderr split is load-bearing, not stylistic:
 *
 *   stdout = THE ANSWER   (parsed by hooks, skills, `jq`)
 *   stderr = ASIDES       (advisory; ten call sites pipe it to /dev/null)
 *
 * The tracker's absent-store bug survived for months precisely because it put its
 * only real signal on stderr. Anything a caller must not miss goes to stdout and is
 * reflected in the exit code. Nothing important is ever whispered.
