/**
 * CLI smoke test — the file-IO path, end to end.
 *
 * The unit tests (ready.spec.js / validate.spec.js) exercise the pure functions with
 * inline data and never touch disk. This test closes that gap: it spawns the real
 * `cli.js` against committed fixtures (test/fixtures/, test/fixtures-epics/) via the
 * `DIARIUM_ROOT` env seam, so resolveRoot, loadTasks, the YAML parse, flag dispatch and
 * the exit codes actually run in CI.
 *
 * `run()` keeps stdout and stderr SEPARATE, deliberately. The tracker's absent-store
 * defect survived for so long precisely because its only complaint went to stderr while
 * stdout carried a well-formed, fictional empty backlog — and ten call sites pipe stderr
 * to /dev/null. A test that concatenates the two streams cannot tell the difference, and
 * so cannot catch a regression of that bug.
