/**
 * The error boundary. All logic lives in lib/.
 *
 * Exit codes carry meaning, and one of them is the whole point of this tool:
 *
 *   0  the answer is on stdout
 *   1  InputError — you got it wrong. Most importantly: THERE IS NO STORE HERE.
 *   2  ResultError — it ran, and the answer is "no" (invalid store, --strict)
 *
 * NOTHING ELSE MAY USE 2. peowly's `showHelp()` defaults to `exit(2)` for "incorrect
 * usage", which would collide head-on with ResultError and leave a CI job unable to tell
 * a dependency cycle from a typo. `main.js` therefore intercepts the bare invocation, the
 * unknown command, and the unknown flag, and re-throws each as an InputError carrying the
 * code `EUSAGE` — so a machine consumer can tell "you typed it wrong" (EUSAGE) from
 * "there is no store here" (ENOSTORE) without regexing a human sentence.
 *
 * Under `--json`, an InputError is emitted as JSON on STDOUT, not as prose on
 * stderr. That is deliberate and it is the fix for the defect this CLI was built
 * around: the old readers printed `{"ready": []}` to stdout and their only
 * complaint to stderr — a stream that ten call sites pipe to /dev/null — so a
 * tracker that could not find its store was indistinguishable from one reporting
 * an empty backlog. Anything a caller must not miss goes to stdout, and shows up
 * in the exit code. Nothing important is whispered.

  // ~64 KB into unparseable JSON — a `--json` consumer's `jq` fails, it falls back to "no data",
  // and a broken store reads as an empty one. The founding defect, re-entered through the exit code
  // that reports it. Setting `exitCode` lets Node drain stdout and exit naturally.
  //
  // Which means these handlers no longer TERMINATE — so they must not fall through. They used to be
  // three sequential `if`s that each ended in `exit()`; drop the exit and a ResultError would sail
  // on into the "genuinely unexpected" branch and be answered with a stack trace.
