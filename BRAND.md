# diarie — Brand

*Status: v0.1.1, drawn 2026-07-18 and revised the same day after an external
audit. Canonical. `brand-book.html` is a rendering of this file and the token
files; when they disagree, the files win.*

This is the visual and verbal identity of diarie, held to the same test as the
code: **plain files you own, and nothing that owns you back.** The brand is a
markdown file, two token files, three hand-editable SVG:s, and two
agent-facing projections — [`DESIGN.md`](./brand/DESIGN.md) for the system (the
google-labs design.md format, lintable) and [`HANDOFF.md`](./brand/HANDOFF.md)
for the built pages. There is no
portal, no Figma you must be invited to, no webfont CDN phoning home.
Uninstall everything and the identity is still here, in the repo, diffable.

## The idea

**One anchor: the diarium.** Every Swedish myndighet keeps one — the
registry where each incoming and outgoing handling is recorded, numbered,
findable, never hidden. That is offentlighetsprincipen, 1766, the world's
first freedom-of-information law, and it maps onto the invariants one to
one. A malformed row is represented, never silently dropped. Git is the
audit log. Every task has its id — its diarienummer. The register aesthetic
is not decoration on the ethos; it *is* the ethos, 250 years older than the
tool. When the brand must say one thing, it says this.

**Two supporting motifs**, subordinate to the anchor:

- **Herbarium** — the -arium sibling, an archive of living things — gives
  the identity its mark and its warmth. Linné's specimen sheets are
  280-year-old plain files: paper, a pressed flower, a label, a stamp —
  still readable, no vendor, no format rot. His taxonomy is diarie's type
  system (one genus per specimen, many descriptors), and the dependency
  graph is the root system, with `ready` above the soil.
- **Genomlysning** — examining a sheet by backlighting it, which in Swedish
  is also the word for scrutiny — gives the mark its halo. Not an aura: the
  light table. The glow *is* the honesty.

One sentence, for when only one fits: *diarie is a public record of your
own work — pressed flat, backlit, and honest.*

## The mark

The mark is a pressed *Linnaea borealis* — the twinflower, named for Linné,
his own favorite: a small, modest, Nordic woodland plant. Two nodding bells
on one forked stem, which is also the tool's central pair — the CLI reads,
your editor writes. Behind it, the light table: a halo in four flat steps.

Files: [`diarie-mark.svg`](./brand/diarie-mark.svg) (square),
[`diarie-favicon.svg`](./brand/diarie-favicon.svg) (the pixel cut: leaves and
bracts dropped, strokes thickened, bells enlarged — use it below 24 px,
the full mark above) and
[`diarie-lockup.svg`](./brand/diarie-lockup.svg) (mark + wordmark). Both are
commented and meant to be edited by hand; the lockup's wordmark is Fraunces
converted to outlines, so neither file needs a font installed.

Rules, few and firm:

- **The halo is stepped, never a gradient.** This is risograph light, not
  lens flare. Four steps: `lysning-1` through `lysning-4`, outer to inner.
- **The flower is papper or arkiv.** Cream on dark, ink on paper. No third
  color, no gradients, no outline version.
- **Clearspace is one bell-height** on all sides (26 units on the mark's
  256 grid). Minimum size: 24 px for the mark, 140 px wide for the lockup.
- **Don't** detach the bells, tilt the mark, add a drop shadow, place it on
  photography, or animate it beyond the one sanctioned reveal (see Motion).

Named honestly, because the reader is honest: the twinflower is not an
unclaimed symbol. It appears in Linné's own coat of arms (1757) and in the
Linnean Society of London's heraldry — scientific-heritage bodies, not
software, so confusion risk is low but not zero. And *Linnea* is among
Sweden's most common given names: to a Swedish eye the flower reads as
culturally familiar rather than proprietary. diarie borrows the specimen;
it does not claim the species.

## Color

Names are Swedish, ASCII-folded in code. The glossary, so nothing is a
secret handshake: *arkiv* — archive; *yta* — surface; *lysning*, from
*genomlysning* — backlighting, scrutiny; *papper* — paper; *hektograf* — the
violet copying-ink of old offices, the color of every stamp pad and
anilinpenna in every Swedish myndighet of the analog era; *lavendel* —
lavender; *fosfor* — phosphor, the green of the terminal; *bärnsten* — amber;
*stämpel* — stamp.

Canonical values live in [`tokens.css`](./brand/tokens.css) (with
[`tokens.json`](./brand/tokens.json) as the tooling twin). The palette, with its
verified WCAG ratios:

| token | hex | role | WCAG 2.x | APCA Lc |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `arkiv` | `#171126` | page ground | — | — |
| `yta` / `yta-2` | `#1F1733` / `#2A1F45` | raised surfaces, code | — | — |
| `lysning-1…4` | `#221940 → #4B3A87` | the halo, outer → inner | decorative | decorative |
| `papper` | `#EFE6D2` | text on dark; paper surface | 14.78:1 | −91 |
| `lavendel` | `#B7ABDD` | secondary text | 8.63:1 | −60 |
| `hektograf-ljus` | `#9C90C4` | muted text | 6.29:1 | −45 |
| `hektograf` | `#6B4FC8` | ink: borders, display; body on papper | 3.13 / 4.73:1 | −22 / 65 |
| `fosfor` | `#5CE49A` | the terminal's voice | 11.37:1 | −75 |
| `bärnsten` | `#E8A13C` | warnings, staleness | 8.38:1 | −59 |
| `stämpel` | `#D8453E` | the rejection stamp | 4.23:1 — large only | −32 |
| `stämpel-ljus` / `-mörk` | `#E8756B` / `#A83732` | red at body size, dark / paper | 6.28 / 5.19:1 | −46 / 67 |

APCA values are Lc per APCA-W3 0.0.98G-4g (negative = light-on-dark), given
alongside WCAG 2.x because APCA is the stricter, perceptually honest model —
and it is stricter here in two places worth naming. `hektograf` on arkiv
scores Lc −22: decorative and border use only, even at display sizes.
`stämpel-ljus` scores Lc −46: fine for short status labels, not for
paragraphs. Where the two models disagree, follow APCA.

**The highlights have jobs.** This is the rule that keeps the palette from
being a mood board. The accents are the exit-code contract, in color:

- `fosfor` is **exit 0** and `ready` — the answer, on stdout. It speaks for
  the CLI and for nothing else. Never use it decoratively where it could be
  mistaken for "this is workable".
- `bärnsten` is **exit 1** — you asked wrong (`ENOSTORE`, `EUSAGE`,
  `EEXIST`) — and stale claims. Correctable, not condemned.
- `stämpel` is **exit 2** — it ran, and the answer is no. The stamp belongs
  to `validate`, because `validate` is the authority that rejects.

On wide-gamut screens the highlights are served again in OKLCH at higher
chroma, guarded by `color-gamut: p3` — same lightness and hue, so the
ratios above hold; the phosphor simply glows harder where the glass allows.
The brand book's swatches stay sRGB on purpose: the printed hex must be the
color shown.

One hazard, named plainly because pretending otherwise would be off-brand:
dark ground with a single acid-green accent is a default AI aesthetic in
2026. What keeps this palette specific is everything the default lacks — the
paper, the stamps, the stepped light, the amber and red as full citizens,
and the fact that every accent is a semantic claim you can check against the
CLI:s actual exit codes.

## Type

Two voices, no third — because the architecture has exactly two sides:

- **The archive voice** is [Fraunces](https://github.com/undercasetype/Fraunces)
  (OFL): what the human wrote. Old-style, soft-serifed, a bit wonky — the
  hand in the herbarium label.
- **The reader voice** is
  [Fragment Mono](https://github.com/weiweihuanghuang/fragment-mono) (OFL):
  what the CLI reports. Plain, legible, unornamented — klarspråk as a
  typeface.

Fraunces is a variable font; the cuts are tokens:

| cut | axes | use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ordmärke` | opsz 144 · wght 520 · SOFT 60 · WONK 1 | the wordmark and hero only, ≥ 40 px |
| `rubrik` | opsz 72 · wght 480 · SOFT 40 · WONK 1 | headings |
| `brödtext` | opsz 15 · wght 415 · SOFT 0 · WONK 0 | running text — wonk off at reading sizes |

Neither family declares a Reserved Font Name in its upstream OFL notice
(verified against both projects' license files), so subsetting and inlining
require attribution only — the copyright lines travel in a comment at the
bottom of every page.

**Fonts are self-hosted, always.** No Google Fonts hotlinking, no font CDN:s
— partly the LG München GDPR ruling, mostly the principle: a page that
depends on a third party to render its own name has already lost the
argument this project exists to make. On diarie.dev the subset woff2:s are
inlined as data URI:s, so the page is one file and arrives whole. Regenerate
the subsets from the upstream OFL files with:

```bash
pyftsubset "Fraunces[SOFT,WONK,opsz,wght].ttf" --flavor=woff2 \
  --unicodes="U+0020-007E,U+00A0-00FF,U+2013-2014,U+2018-2019,U+201C-201D,U+2022,U+2026,U+2192,U+00B7" \
  --layout-features="*" --no-hinting
```

## Voice

The register is klarspråk. Swedish law requires public language to be
*vårdat, enkelt och begripligt* — cared-for, simple, comprehensible
(Språklagen 2009:600, §11) — and a tool named after a myndighet's registry
writes like one, at its best. The README already does; this section only
writes the rules down.

1. **Name the consequence, not the adjective.** Not "invalid priority" but
   "invalid priority `urgent` — it will be treated as `medium`". The
   consequence is the part that tells the reader whether to care.
2. **The refusal is part of the product.** Say no plainly, give the reason,
   and where one exists, name the revival trigger. Never apologize for a
   design decision; never hide one.
3. **No superlatives.** The strongest available sentence is a plain claim:
   "That is the whole product." If a sentence would survive on a SaaS
   landing page, rewrite it.
4. **diarie is lowercase.** Always, including at the start of a sentence.
   It is a command, not a company.
5. **House punctuation:** the em-dash pivot (setup — destination) and the
   colon as the seam between claim and evidence. Both make the reasoning
   visible, which is the point of the reasoning.
6. **Never anthropomorphize past the one licensed phrase:** *the reader is
   honest.* The tool has no feelings, only obligations.
7. **Swedish is seasoning, not gatekeeping.** Loanwords welcome — always
   glossed on first use.

Words that do not appear: *blazing, seamless, powerful, supercharge,
game-changing, simply, just* (the adverb), and any sentence beginning
"Unlock".

## Motion

Motion follows the same discipline as color: scarce, and with a job.

- **At most three beats per page; the hero owns one.** Everything else is
  functional transition, not spectacle.
- **Never on the install command or any call to action.** Motion that leans
  on a decision is a dark pattern; diarie does not lean.
- **One easing:** `--ease-lysning`, `cubic-bezier(0.22, 0, 0.18, 1)` — slow
  start, fast middle, very slow stop; the light coming up on the table.
  Never the browser's default `ease`.
- **Reduced motion is full parity.** `prefers-reduced-motion` gets the
  complete page, rendered at once — the same information, calm. Degrading
  honestly applies to animation too.
- **Nothing runs longer than two seconds,** and below-the-fold beats fire
  once per session, not on every scroll.

## Applications

**The CLI itself.** Terminal output uses the semantic tokens: ready rows in
`fosfor`, stale claims in `bärnsten`, `validate` findings in `stämpel`,
structure in `lavendel`. `NO_COLOR` and non-TTY output are respected without
information loss — color is annotation, never the message.

**The stamp.** Releases carry the diarienummer device: a rectangular date
stamp, stamp-red, reading `INKOM <date>` over `dnr <version>` — the mark a
registrar puts on a handling the day it arrives. It appears on the site
footer, in release notes, and nowhere else — a stamp used everywhere
certifies nothing. On the pages it is drawn as outlined SVG: rotated text
as geometry, so no rasterizer's pixel grid can stair-step it. Its sibling `granskad` (examined) may appear once, on a
specimen sheet.

**The small devices.** The marker wash — a hektograf tint over a key
phrase, at most three per page, because emphasis is scarce; borderless ink
with hand-uneven corners, never confusable with the bordered, square-cornered
code chip — if the two are confusable, one of them is styled wrong. And the leaf
rule: a hairline carrying the mark's opposite leaf-pair, letting the scene
recur between sections. The closing line on any diarie surface makes the
exit the pitch — leaving is free, and saying so is the brand.

**diarie.dev.** One static HTML document. Fonts inlined, zero external
requests, no analytics, no cookies, no consent banner because there is
nothing to consent to. The consequence, named: ≈152 KiB of subset fonts
become ≈203 KiB of base64 (+33 %), the page lands around a quarter-megabyte
as a single request, and fonts cannot be cached separately from it — a
repeat visit refetches everything unless the file itself is cached.
Performance orthodoxy says split them; diarie keeps the one file because
the page is the artifact — it survives `curl`, `file://`, and the archive
whole — and pays the cost knowingly. If measurement ever shows LCP above
2.5 s on a cold mobile load, that is the named trigger for revisiting.
Two sibling assets exist: `og.png` (1200 × 630), the link-preview card —
path-rendered from the mark, wordmark, and tagline so it needs no fonts. Scrapers and
iOS fetch them; the page never does. View source is a feature: the page practices what the
tool preaches, and it survives `curl`, `file://`, and the Internet Archive
without modification.

**The README.** Badges only for claims that are true and checkable (license,
CI, version). No stars-counter theater.

## The refusals, brand edition

Like the roadmap's non-goals, these are identity:

- **No gradient glow.** The halo is stepped or it is not the halo. The
  sanctioned atmosphere is stepped light at any scale and static print
  grain (`--korn`, ≤ 5 % opacity) — risograph, never lens flare.
- **No mascot.** The twinflower is a specimen, not a character. It does not
  wave, wink, or wear a hard hat during errors.
- **No dark-pattern motion** — no pulsing CTA:s, no fake urgency, no
  confetti at the moment of a decision.
- **No tracking, ever,** on any diarie surface. A registry that surveils its
  readers has misunderstood which direction the transparency goes.
- **No third typeface, no second easing, no off-token colors.** Scarcity is
  what makes the system legible.
- **No brand asset behind a login.** The brand is files. Leaving — forking,
  re-theming, deleting — must always be free.

## Lineage

The same canon as [VISION.md](./VISION.md), applied one layer up: local-first
(Ink & Switch), convivial tools (Illich), calm technology (Weiser & Brown),
worse-is-better (Gabriel), and the indieweb's own-your-data ethos — plus
Linné's herbarium and the Swedish diarium, which were local-first before the
term, and klarspråk, which was tone-of-voice guidance before brand books.
The canon is not borrowed for the occasion — the library shows the
receipts: its copy of the Ink & Switch manifesto carries a note tracing
Adam Wiggins from the Twelve-Factor App (2011) to co-authoring Local-first
software (2019), cloud orthodoxy writing its own critique; and the
highlight archive keeps the personal-web ethos in others' words — Zeldman
on the old web "where people shared honestly on their personal sites,"
Heilmann's "everybody is invited to consume, contribute and create."  Maggie Appleton's
[Home-Cooked Software](https://maggieappleton.com/home-cooked-software)
carries the Illich thread — that people "should have agency and ownership
over their data and software." Amber Case's calm-technology work holds the
standard the site aims at: the smallest possible claim on attention. And
Jeremy Keith's [Declarative design](https://adactio.com/journal/18982)
names the test diarie applies to itself: "It all depends on whether the
philosophy behind the tool matches your own philosophy."

A visual identity is a small place to apply them. That is the point.
