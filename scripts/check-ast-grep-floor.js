/**
 * `check:ast-grep` with a coverage FLOOR (vp-beads-flr).
 *
 * diarie's ast-grep check is a bare `ast-grep scan` — no path list — deliberately, so a rule can
 * never be scoped outside a path list the runner forgot to update. But a bare scan is bounded by
 * `.gitignore` (ast-grep honours it as ripgrep does), so ONE broad ignore line — `lib/generated/`,
 * `dist/`, a stray `lib/**` — silently shrinks lint coverage with nothing going red. The bound is
 * moved, not removed: from a path list a runner can check to a git file nobody checks. A reviewer
 * proved it by appending one line and watching the scan go blind (2026-07-14).
 *
 * So don't trust "the scan ran"; assert HOW MUCH it saw. This wraps the same bare scan and reads
 * `scannedFileCount` straight off `--inspect entity`'s stderr summary — ASK ast-grep, don't model
 * it (no second file-set to drift) — and fails if it drops below the floor.
 *
 * THE FLOOR. The scan sees 30 files today (21 lib + 6 test + 2 root + this script). The floor is
 * set below that with a small margin: a broad ignore trips it hard (`lib/**` → 9, `test/**` → 24,
 * both < 25), while a few files of legitimate churn do not. A SURPRISING drop below the floor is the signal —
 * so when the package genuinely grows or shrinks past it, bump this number DELIBERATELY, the same
 * way you would a coverage threshold. That deliberate edit is the whole point.
 *
 * Only literal exit codes here: diarie's own `no-computed-exit-code` rule scans this file (the bare
 * scan walks the whole package), so a real violation is collapsed to a plain `exit(1)`, never a
 * propagated `exit(r.status)`.
