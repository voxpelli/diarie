title: Brand markdown tables are linted like every other doc; DESIGN.md's design.md warnings are accepted, not suppressed

## Decision

The brand markdown files (`BRAND.md`'s contrast tables and the tables in `brand/DESIGN.md` /
`brand/HANDOFF.md`) are linted by the repository's ordinary remark config — GFM, padded table
cells — like every other tracked markdown file. They are NOT excluded from `check:md`.

`brand/DESIGN.md` additionally carries the google-labs design.md lint
(`npx @google/design.md lint`), whose 11 warnings are **accepted with a stated reason** in the
file's own header (palette members referenced by the page ground, halo, borders, and terminal
states rather than by a schema component), not suppressed and not "fixed" into silence.

## Rationale

* **No unlinted island.** Excluding the brand docs from remark would create files that ship and
  are reviewed yet are invisible to the gate — the exact "green over files nobody chose to
  exclude" hazard `vp-beads-imd` tracks. Linting them keeps them honest.
* **Reformatting was cosmetic.** When the brand files landed, remark reformatted the tables by
  cell-padding only (`diff -bw` clean), so bringing them under the linter cost nothing
  semantic.
* **Accept-with-reason beats suppress.** The 11 design.md warnings carry information; recording
  why they are acceptable in the header is more honest than a blanket ignore that a later reader
  cannot distinguish from an overlooked defect.

## Alternatives Considered

* **Exclude the brand docs from remark** — declined; creates an unlinted island.
* **Suppress the design.md warnings** — declined; they are legitimate palette references, and
  accept-with-reason preserves the signal a suppression would erase.

## Affects

* `diarie/BRAND.md`, `diarie/brand/DESIGN.md`, `diarie/brand/HANDOFF.md`
* the repository's remark config / `check:md` (and `vp-beads-imd`, which tracks a broader
  `check:md` exclusion hole through `--ignore-pattern`)
* at extraction, diarie's own `check:md` — if it adds one — inherits this posture.
* **REALIZED 2026-07-18.** diarie's own `check:md` now exists (`remark . --frail --ignore-path
  .gitignore`, no per-file exclusions) plus a `fix:md` fixer. The brand docs and every decision
  `.md` are linted under it; on first run it re-padded the brand tables (cosmetic, `diff -bw`
  clean) and `remark-validate-links` caught the `brand/DESIGN.md` `./BRAND.md` → `../BRAND.md`
  regression. The load-bearing decision-_frontmatter_ gap stays open under `diarie-dlm`.
